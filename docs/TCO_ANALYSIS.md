## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Architecture

**Hot Data (< 30 days)**: On-premise MinIO
**Warm Data (30-90 days)**: On-premise compressed
**Cold Data (> 90 days)**: AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive

### Cost Breakdown

| Tier | Storage | Location | Annual Cost |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Hot** | 225 GB | MinIO | $3,000 (OpEx portion) |
| **Warm** | 225 GB (compressed) | MinIO | Included above |
| **Cold** | 2,830 GB | S3 Glacier Deep Archive @ $0.00099/GB | $33.64 |
| **Egress** | 50 GB/month | Glacier retrieval | $600 |
| **Total** | 3,280 GB | | **$3,633.64/year** |

**3-Year Hybrid TCO:**
```
Year 1: MinIO setup ($28,625) + Glacier ($3,634) = $32,259
Year 2: MinIO OpEx ($12,425) + Glacier ($3,634) = $16,059
Year 3: MinIO OpEx ($12,925) + Glacier ($3,634) = $16,559

Total 3-Year: $64,877
```

│  Hybrid:      -$2,268 (-4%)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Note**: Conservative estimate. Real savings likely higher due to:
- No cloud egress charges on-premise
- No API request fees on-premise
- Predictable OpEx vs variable cloud costs

## Breakeven Analysis

### On-Premise Breakeven Point

```
CapEx: $16,200
Monthly OpEx (On-Prem): $1,036
Monthly Cost (Cloud): $1,630

Breakeven = CapEx / (Cloud Monthly - On-Prem Monthly)
         = $16,200 / ($1,630 - $1,036)
         = $16,200 / $594
         = 27.3 months ≈ 28 months
```

**Breakeven: 28 months (2.3 years)**

After 28 months, on-premise solution starts generating savings.

### 5-Year Projection

| Solution | 5-Year Total Cost |
|----------|------------------|
| **On-Premise** | $82,175 |
| **Cloud** | $110,434 |
| **Savings** | **$28,259 (26%)** |
