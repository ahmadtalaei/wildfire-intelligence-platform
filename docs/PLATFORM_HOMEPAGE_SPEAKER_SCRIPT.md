The monitoring grid contains four metric cards arranged horizontally… each showing a different data category.


The first card on the left displays Fire Incidents with a fire emoji…

The large number shows the current count of fire incidents in the database…

Below that… a timestamp indicates when the latest fire incident was detected… for example… Last: two minutes ago or Last: three hours ago…

This tells fire managers how fresh their fire detection data is… critical for rapid response.


Next to it… the Weather Data card appears with a sun-cloud icon…

This shows the total count of weather readings ingested from NOAA stations and forecast models…

The timestamp below indicates the most recent weather update… such as Last: just now or Last: fifteen minutes ago…

Fresh weather data is essential for fire behavior prediction… as temperature, humidity, and wind speed directly influence fire spread rates.


The third card displays Sensor Data with a satellite antenna icon…

This counts IoT sensor readings from air quality monitors and field-deployed equipment…

The timestamp shows when the latest sensor transmitted data… helping identify offline sensors that may need maintenance.


Finally… the fourth card shows Data Ingestion status with a lightning bolt icon…

Instead of a count… this displays a status indicator… either Active with a check mark or Inactive with an X…

Below that… it shows Processed: followed by the total number of records processed… such as Processed: twelve thousand five hundred…

This gives real-time visibility into whether the ingestion pipeline is running correctly.


## Interactive Control Buttons

Below the metric cards… three interactive buttons provide quick actions…

The first button… Trigger Data Fetch with a rocket emoji… has an orange background…

Clicking this immediately initiates a manual data pull from NASA FIRMS satellites… fetching the latest fire detections from MODIS and VIIRS sensors…

The results appear in a gray console box below… showing how many fire detections were found… for example… MODIS: forty-seven fire detections, VIIRS: thirty-two fire detections…

This manual trigger is useful for demonstrations or when immediate data refresh is needed outside the normal polling schedule.

This is the heart of Challenge One… handling batch, real-time, and streaming data with sub-second latency.


The Metrics Monitoring Service card follows…

This explains… Advanced metrics collection and monitoring for latency, fidelity, and system performance…

Prometheus metrics exported from this service power the Grafana dashboards judges use to evaluate Challenge One deliverables.


## Services Grid - User Dashboards

Now we reach the user-facing dashboard cards…

Fire Chief Dashboard appears with login credentials information…

The description states… Advanced React dashboard for fire chiefs with real-time monitoring and resource management…

The Open Dashboard button launches the interface at port three thousand one… where fire chiefs see active fire maps, crew deployment status, and incident command tools…

This serves operational leadership… providing tactical decision support during active wildfire events.


Next… Data Analyst Portal presents analytical capabilities…

The description reads… Advanced data analytics and intelligence platform for comprehensive wildfire data analysis…

Clicking Open Portal navigates to port three thousand two… where analysts generate statistical reports, trend analyses, and executive summaries.

For Challenge Two… the storage service cards, MinIO console, and monitoring dashboards demonstrate the hybrid architecture and cost optimization…

For Challenge Three… multiple pathways to user dashboards and the data clearing house showcase the comprehensive data consumption layer.


The real-time monitoring section proves the system is actively processing data… not just showing mock screenshots…

The interactive Trigger Data Fetch button allows judges to see data flow end-to-end… from satellite API call… through ingestion validation… to database storage… to dashboard display… all within seconds.


By consolidating access to fifteen-plus services into a single organized page… we demonstrate professional systems engineering… making it easy for judges to navigate and evaluate each component without hunting through documentation for URLs and credentials.


## Technical Implementation

Behind this clean interface… the homepage uses vanilla JavaScript for real-time updates…

Every thirty seconds… fetch API calls query the storage service at port eight thousand one for statistics… and the ingestion service at port eight thousand three for processing status…

The responses are JSON objects containing counts and timestamps… which JavaScript dynamically injects into the HTML metric cards.


The service cards use CSS grid layout… automatically adapting to screen size… displaying three columns on desktop… two on tablet… and one on mobile…

Hover effects add subtle animations… lifting cards slightly and deepening shadows… providing tactile feedback without overwhelming the interface.


The purple gradient background creates visual appeal while maintaining readability… using sufficient contrast between white cards and the colored backdrop…

Status indicators use CSS animations… pulsing every two seconds to draw attention… ensuring operators notice when services are healthy or degraded.


This homepage connects to our entire platform… serving as the orchestration layer judges use to navigate from high-level overview… to detailed dashboards… to API specifications… to live data demonstrations… all supporting the holistic evaluation of our Wildfire Intelligence Platform for the fifty-thousand-dollar CAL FIRE challenge.
