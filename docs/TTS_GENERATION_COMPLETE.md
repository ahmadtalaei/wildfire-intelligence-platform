## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Refinements)

The document is ready to use! However, for even higher quality, you may want to:

### Optional Manual Enhancements (1-2 hours)

#### 1. Spell Out Key Numbers

The script preserved numbers as digits. For maximum TTS quality, consider spelling out frequently mentioned numbers:

**High-priority numbers to spell out:**
- `870` → "eight hundred seventy"
- `3,247` → "three thousand two hundred forty-seven"
- `10,847` → "ten thousand eight hundred forty-seven"
- `99.92` → "ninety-nine point nine two"
- `98.7` → "ninety-eight point seven"
- `350,440` → "three hundred fifty thousand four hundred forty"

**Tool**: Use Find & Replace in VS Code (`Ctrl+H`)

#### 2. Add More Visual Position References

Current: `"Looking at the KEY ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATIONS section"`

Could enhance to: `"Looking at the KEY ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATIONS section at the center..."`

Add positional words like:
- "at the top"
- "on the left side"
- "on the right"
- "in the bottom section"
- "in the center"

#### 3. Add More Natural Pauses

Current pauses are good, but you could add more ellipses (`...`) where natural breathing occurs.

## 🎤 Testing with OpenAI TTS

### Quick Test Script

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pathlib import Path

client = OpenAI()

# Read your generated file
doc_path = Path('C:/dev/wildfire/docs/CHALLENGE_1_FIRE_DATA_PRESENTATION_TTS.md')
with open(doc_path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Extract a speaker script section (manually copy/paste)
test_script = """
[Copy a speaker script section from the file]
"""

# Generate audio
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1-hd",  # High quality model
    voice="onyx",      # Professional male voice
    # voice="nova",    # Professional female voice (alternative)
    input=test_script[:4000],  # TTS limit is 4096 chars
    speed=0.95  # Slightly slower for clarity
)

# Save to file
response.stream_to_file("test_output.mp3")
print("✅ Generated: test_output.mp3")
```

### Voice Options
- **onyx**: Deep, professional male
- **alloy**: Neutral, clear
- **echo**: Authoritative male
- **fable**: Expressive male
- **nova**: Professional female
- **shimmer**: Warm female

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Presentation Delivery

1. **Open both files side-by-side:**
   - Visual: `CHALLENGE_1_FIRE_DATA_PRESENTATION.md` (slides)
   - Audio: `CHALLENGE_1_FIRE_DATA_PRESENTATION_TTS.md` (narration)

2. **Generate audio per slide:**
   - Extract each speaker script section
   - Generate TTS audio
   - Sync with slide display

3. **Batch processing:**
   ```python
   # Process all 43 scripts
   import re

   with open('CHALLENGE_1_FIRE_DATA_PRESENTATION_TTS.md') as f:
       content = f.read()

   # Extract all speaker scripts
   scripts = re.findall(
       r'## 🎤 \*\*Speaker Script\*\*(.*?)(?=\n##[^#]|\Z)',
       content,
       re.DOTALL
   )

   print(f"Found {len(scripts)} speaker scripts")
   # Generate TTS for each...
   ```
