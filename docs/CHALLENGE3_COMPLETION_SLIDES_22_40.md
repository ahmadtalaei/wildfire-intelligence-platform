## 🎤 **Speaker Script**

"Audit Event Types and Risk Scoring classifies thirteen thousand six hundred fifty daily events across ten categories with machine learning-based risk assessment.

Ten event types vary in volume and risk. Login events average one thousand two hundred per day with risk range zero to one hundred. Data Access averages eight thousand five hundred per day with risk up to eighty. Query Execution three thousand four hundred per day with risk to ninety. Data Export four hundred fifty per day with high risk to ninety five.

Config Change is low volume twelve per day but high risk fifty to one hundred. User Management twenty five per day with risk forty to one hundred. Role Assignment eight per day with risk sixty to one hundred. Permission Grant fifteen per day risk fifty to one hundred. Security Alert thirty five per day risk seventy to one hundred. Compliance Violation five per day critical risk eighty to one hundred.

Risk Scoring Algorithm combines base factors with machine learning. Base risk factors include event sensitivity... zero to thirty points based on action type. User role privilege zero to twenty points with admins scoring highest. Time of day adds zero to fifteen points... business hours score zero... off-hours add ten... weekends add fifteen.

Geolocation anomaly scores zero if same city as last login... plus ten for different state... plus fifteen for different country. Frequency anomaly compares to baseline... within two standard deviations scores zero... two to three sigma adds ten... beyond three sigma adds twenty.

ML Enhancement uses Isolation Forest for multivariate anomaly detection. Features include all base factors plus failed attempts and data volume. Training uses ninety-day rolling window. Contamination rate assumes five percent expected outliers. Output is anomaly score zero to one point zero scaled to zero to one hundred.

Final Risk Score equals Base Score plus ML Anomaly Score normalized to zero to one hundred scale.

Alerting triggers based on four risk tiers. Low Risk zero to forty nine logs only with weekly batch review covering normal business operations. Medium Risk fifty to seventy nine adds to analyst review queue with twenty four-hour S L A for off-hours access and elevated query volume.

High Risk eighty to ninety four triggers real-time email and Slack alerts with one-hour acknowledgment S L A covering unusual export patterns and config changes. Critical Risk ninety five to one hundred sends S M S and PagerDuty alerts... auto-locks the account... and requires fifteen-minute response for compliance violations and suspected breaches.

This dynamic risk scoring transforms static audit logs into intelligent threat detection identifying suspicious activity requiring immediate investigation."

"Alert Mechanisms for Anomalous Behavior implement four-tier real-time notification with automated response actions protecting California's wildfire platform.

Tier One Email Alerts handle low to medium risk events. Five-member security team distribution list. Fifteen-second delivery S L A. H T M L format includes event details... risk score... user context. Batched delivery sends maximum one email per five minutes preventing alert fatigue.

Tier Two Slack Notifications escalate high-risk events. Security-alerts channel monitored twenty four-seven. Real-time delivery under five seconds. Rich card format with action buttons for Investigate and Acknowledge. At-mentions alert security-team for high-risk events requiring immediate review.

Tier Three S M S and Phone Alerts handle critical risk. On-call admin receives text within thirty seconds. Format includes event I D... user... and risk score. Escalation triggers voice call if not acknowledged within five minutes.

Tier Four PagerDuty Incident triggers at risk score ninety five or higher or any compliance violation. Immediate delivery. Auto-actions execute instantly. Lock user account revoking JWT tokens. Block I P address at firewall. Create Jira incident ticket. Notify CISO via S M S. Take database snapshot for forensics. Escalation policy moves from Level One at five minutes to Level Two at fifteen minutes to Level Three at thirty minutes.

Automated Response Actions protect the platform without human intervention. Account Lockout triggers at risk ninety or higher. Revokes all active JWT tokens. Invalidates refresh tokens. Terminates active sessions. Sets account status to LOCKED. Notifies user via email if not suspected attacker. Requires admin approval to unlock.

I P Blacklisting triggers at risk ninety five or higher. Adds I P to Kong A P I Gateway blocklist. Adds I P to firewall deny rule via iptables or nftables. Duration twenty four hours with auto-expire. Whitelist override requires admin approval.

Data Export Prevention triggers for export violations. Blocks all export A P I endpoints for user. Quarantines recently exported files. Notifies dataset steward. Requires written justification and approval to re-enable.

Forensic Data Collection activates for all critical incidents. Captures point-in-time database snapshot. Exports relevant audit logs for twenty four-hour window. Screenshots user's last dashboard view. Collects network flow logs via NetFlow. Stores in immutable forensics bucket using S Three Object Lock.

Five Anomaly Detection Examples demonstrate real-world scenarios. Unusual Query Volume detected user executing four hundred seventy three queries in ten minutes versus baseline of twelve. Risk score eighty five. Tier Two Slack alert. Flag for review but no auto-lock.

Off-Hours Data Export detected export of ten thousand two hundred forty seven records at eleven thirty seven P M from user who never accesses system after six P M. Risk score seventy eight. Tier Two Slack alert. Notify security team and monitor for twenty four hours.

Geolocation Anomaly detected login from Moscow Russia for user who always logs in from Sacramento California. Risk score ninety two. Tier Three S M S plus Tier Four PagerDuty alert. Auto-lock account and investigate immediately.

Failed MFA Attempts detected seven consecutive failures in five minutes for user with baseline under one failure per month. Risk score eighty eight. Tier Three S M S alert. Lock account after fifth failure and alert user.

Compliance Violation detected attempt to export personally identifiable information without data loss prevention approval. Risk score ninety nine. Tier Four PagerDuty alert. Auto-lock account... block I P... notify CISO... create incident.

Alert Acknowledgment tracks response. Slack users click Acknowledge button. Email users reply with A C K incident I D. PagerDuty uses mobile app. Resolution requires admin notes and investigator assignment. Mean Time To Acknowledge is eight minutes average. Mean Time To Resolve is two point three hours average.

False Positive Handling improves system accuracy. Admin marks alerts as false positive. System learns from feedback retraining ML model. Baseline adjusts for new normal behavior. Current false positive rate is eight percent with target under five percent.

This intelligent alerting system ensures rapid response to threats while minimizing alert fatigue through risk-based tiering and automated actions."

"Compliance Framework and Regulatory Adherence demonstrates our commitment to meeting the highest federal security standards protecting California's wildfire intelligence.

FISMA Compliance achieves one hundred percent with forty seven of forty seven controls fully implemented. Nine control families address Access Control... Audit and Accountability... Identification and Authentication... System and Communications Protection... Configuration Management... Contingency Planning... Incident Response... Risk Assessment... and Security Assessment and Authorization.

Evidence includes seven-year audit log retention... AES-two fifty six encryption at rest and in transit... multi-factor authentication for privileged users... role-based access control... annual penetration testing... and continuous monitoring via SIEM.

NIST eight hundred fifty three Moderate Baseline satisfies three hundred twenty five of three hundred twenty five controls across seventeen control families. Key highlights include AC-two Account Management automated via IAM... AU-two Event Logging tracking ten event types with seven-year retention... IA-two Identification and Authentication requiring MFA for admins... SC-eight Transmission Confidentiality using TLS one point three... and SC-twenty eight Protection of Information at Rest with AES-two fifty six.

S O C two Type Two Certification is in progress with audit scheduled January twenty twenty six. Five Trust Service Criteria demonstrate comprehensive coverage. Security implemented via RBAC... encryption... and MFA. Availability achieves ninety nine point nine four percent uptime exceeding ninety nine point nine percent S L A. Processing Integrity validates data with quality checks. Confidentiality protects via encryption... data loss prevention... and secure sandbox. Privacy criterion is out of scope as no personally identifiable information is collected.

Audit Readiness shows one hundred percent complete control documentation... automated evidence collection via audit logs... annual risk assessment updates... Q four twenty twenty five penetration testing passed... and all vendors risk-assessed.

FedRAMP Moderate Authorization is ready for assessment though not yet initiated. Requirements satisfied include NIST eight hundred fifty three Moderate baseline with three hundred twenty five controls... FIPS one forty-two dash two validated cryptography... continuous monitoring... incident response plan... contingency plan and disaster recovery... System Security Plan documented... Privacy Impact Assessment completed... and E-authentication level two with MFA.

Path to Authorization requires six steps. Select FedRAMP-authorized Third Party Assessor. Complete System Security Plan which is done. Conduct Security Assessment over six to eight weeks. Remediate any findings. Submit authorization package to FedRAMP Program Management Office. And achieve Authority to Operate. Timeline estimates six to nine months.

Additional Compliance covers HIPAA marked N slash A as no Protected Health Information exists. GDPR is minimal covering only California residents with no EU data. CCPA complies with California Consumer Privacy Act. CalOES Reporting maintains one hundred percent on-time submissions for twelve of twelve months. And NFPA sixteen twenty satisfies fire risk assessment standards.

Continuous Compliance Monitoring automates control testing daily. Compliance dashboard displays real-time status. Quarterly self-assessments document progress. Annual independent audit engages external auditor. Remediation S L A closes critical findings within thirty days.

Compliance Metrics demonstrate excellence. Control effectiveness is ninety eight point seven percent exceeding target above ninety five percent. Audit finding remediation closes one hundred percent within S L A. Policy exceptions total three... all documented and approved. Compliance incidents total zero in past twelve months. Training completion reaches one hundred percent of staff trained annually.

This comprehensive compliance framework ensures the wildfire platform meets federal security standards... protects sensitive data... and maintains California stakeholder trust."

## 🎤 **Speaker Script**

"Data Lineage Tracking System provides complete source-to-output provenance enabling California fire scientists to trace every dataset from original NASA satellite observation through transformations to final M L model predictions.

The Lineage Database Schema uses PostgreSQL table data underscore lineage with ten key fields. Lineage I D is UUID primary key. Dataset I D links to data catalog. Dataset name and type classify as source... intermediate... or derived. Parent I Ds array tracks upstream datasets. Transformation logic stores S Q L or code. Transformation type categorizes as filter... join... aggregate... or M L. Created timestamp... user I D... version number... and flexible JSON metadata complete the schema.

Lineage Example for Fire Risk Model demonstrates real-world tracking. Dataset fire underscore risk underscore predictions underscore twenty twenty five underscore ten is derived type. Three parent datasets include fire detections source from NASA FIRMS... weather data source from N O A A... and I o T sensor readings source from PurpleAir. Plus intermediate fire weather correlation.

Transformation Logic documents spatial join of fire detections with weather data... calculates wind speed impact on spread rate... applies LSTM model version two point three... and outputs risk score zero to one hundred per grid cell. Created by scientist J Doe at calfire dot gov. Version seven represents seventh model iteration.

Four Lineage Query Capabilities support scientific workflows. Forward Lineage answers What uses this dataset by querying parent I Ds array. Example query What M L models use fire detections returns fire risk predictions... fire spread model... and evacuation planner.

Backward Lineage answers Where did this dataset come from using recursive C T E query traversing parent relationships. Example query for daily fire summary traces NASA FIRMS to fire detections to fire enriched to daily fire summary.

Impact Analysis answers If I change this source what breaks by finding all descendants. Example if NASA FIRMS A P I changes affects twelve downstream datasets... five M L models... and three dashboards.

Transformation Audit answers How was this data transformed by retrieving transformation logic. Example for fire weather correlation shows S Q L with SELECT fire asterisk... weather temp... humidity... wind speed FROM fire detections join weather data using PostGIS ST underscore DWithin for five kilometer spatial join.

Lineage Visualization uses D three dot J S force-directed graph. Node colors encode dataset type. Red for source datasets from external A P Is. Yellow for intermediate transformations. Green for derived outputs and M L models. Edge labels show transformation type. Interactive clicks reveal transformation logic.

Reproducibility and Citations support scientific rigor. Every dataset receives unique D O I... Digital Object Identifier. Citation format specifies Dataset Name version X point Y... CAL FIRE Wildfire Platform... access date... and D O I. Git-style versioning tracks derived datasets. Immutable snapshot I Ds enable exact reproducibility.

Automated Lineage Tracking eliminates manual documentation. ETL jobs via Airflow DAGs auto-log lineage on run. S Q L query parser extracts FROM and JOIN tables as parents. MLflow integration tracks M L model input datasets. Manual exports record lineage when users select datasets.

Compliance and Governance tracking flags data sovereignty if data left California. PII tracking flags datasets containing sensitive data. Retention policy maintains lineage seven years matching data retention. Deletion propagation warns descendants if source deleted preventing broken pipelines.

This comprehensive lineage system transforms opaque data flows into transparent traceable provenance... enabling reproducible science and regulatory compliance for California's wildfire research community."

## 🎤 **Speaker Script**

"ETL and ELT Processes and Transformations power both real-time and batch data integration moving California wildfire intelligence from raw satellite observations to analytics-ready datasets.

Real-Time ETL uses Kafka Streams operating continuously twenty four-seven. Latency at p ninety five is eighty seven milliseconds from source to PostgreSQL. Throughput sustains ten thousand events per second.

Five Pipeline Steps process data in real-time. Step one consumes from Kafka topics wildfire-fire-detections and others. Step two validates Avro schema enforcing data contract. Step three transforms data with geocoding reverse geocoding latitude longitude to county and city... enrichment adding nearest weather station I D... standardization converting units from Kelvin to Celsius... and deduplication using SHA-two fifty six hash check via Redis. Step four loads to PostgreSQL HOT tier. Step five records metrics to Prometheus.

Error Handling routes invalid schema to Dead Letter Queue. Exponential backoff retry waits five seconds... ten seconds... twenty seconds. Maximum three retries. Manual review queue handles failures after three attempts.

Batch ELT uses Airflow DAGs running daily at two A M UTC. Duration is forty five minutes for one hundred thousand records. Throughput achieves ten thousand rows per second.

DAG hot to warm migration executes seven tasks. Task one extracts records via SELECT star FROM fire detections WHERE created at greater than or equal NOW minus seven days AND migrated to warm FALSE. Task two validates running twenty five plus quality checks. Task three transforms converting to Apache Parquet format... applying Snappy compression achieving seventy eight percent ratio... partitioning by date with year slash month slash day folder structure... and adding metadata including row count... file size... and checksum.

Task four loads uploading to MinIO WARM tier. Task five updates metadata catalog recording file path and statistics. Task six marks records as migrated preventing re-processing. Task seven records metrics including row count... duration... and compression ratio.

Airflow Configuration uses LocalExecutor for single machine. Concurrency allows four parallel tasks. S L A is sixty minutes. Retry attempts twice on failure. Email alert sends to data-eng at calfire dot gov on failure.

Five Data Transformations demonstrate processing depth. Geocoding reverse geocodes latitude thirty nine point seven five nine six... longitude negative one twenty one point six two one nine to county Butte... city Paradise using PostGIS query against California counties shapefile in under five milliseconds using spatial index.

Unit Conversion transforms temperature from Kelvin to Celsius subtracting two hundred seventy three point one five. Wind speed converts meters per second to miles per hour multiplying by two point two three six nine four. Area converts hectares to acres multiplying by two point four seven one zero five.

Data Enrichment joins fire detection with nearest weather station using SELECT fire asterisk... weather station I D... temp... humidity... wind speed FROM fire detections CROSS JOIN LATERAL selecting nearest weather station ordered by ST underscore Distance limiting one.

Aggregation calculates daily fire count by county with SELECT county... DATE timestamp... COUNT star as fire count... AVG confidence as average confidence GROUP BY county and date.

Parquet Optimization leverages columnar storage reading only needed columns... predicate pushdown filtering before loading... partition pruning skipping irrelevant date partitions... Snappy compression balancing speed and ratio... and optimal one twenty eight megabyte file size for parallel processing.

Performance Optimization achieves efficiency through four Airflow workers in parallel... batch inserts of ten thousand rows per transaction... connection pooling limiting ten database connections... incremental loads processing only new or changed records... and idempotency enabling rerunnable execution without duplicates.

Monitoring and Alerting track pipeline health. Airflow U I displays DAG run history and task duration. Prometheus metrics record rows processed... duration... and errors. Grafana dashboard visualizes ETL performance trends. Email alerts notify failures. Slack posts daily summary of batch jobs.

This dual-mode ETL and ELT architecture ensures California fire analysts receive both real-time intelligence for immediate response and batch-processed analytics for strategic planning."
