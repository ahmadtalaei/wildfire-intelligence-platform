**ðŸŽ¤ Sync Architecture Overview**

The Wildfire Data Clearing House supports dual mode synchronization... real time streaming for critical alerts and live dashboards... and batch sync for analytics and reporting.

This hybrid approach optimizes for both latency and resource efficiency.

The architecture has four layers working together.

Real Time Sync uses Kafka C D C for Change Data Capture... Kafka Consumer for continuous polling... Stream Processor using Kafka Streams... and Real Time Validator for schema checking.

Batch Sync uses Airflow Scheduler for cron based execution... Batch Extractor for S Q L queries... Incremental Load with watermark tracking... and Full Refresh for complete replacement.

Sync Orchestration includes Sync Controller for hybrid mode selection... Conflict Resolver with last write wins strategy... Checkpoint Manager for offset tracking... and Metric Collector for lag monitoring.

Target Systems receive the synchronized data... the Clearing House Database on PostgreSQL... Search Index on Elasticsearch... Analytics Database on ClickHouse... and Cache Layer on Redis.

### **Sync Mode Comparison**

| Feature | Real-Time Sync | Batch Sync |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Latency** | Less than one second | Fifteen minutes to twenty four hours |
| **Data Volume** | Continuous stream | Bulk transfer |
| **Resource Usage** | Moderate CPU with low memory | High CPU and memory spike |
| **Use Case** | Critical alerts and live dashboards | Analytics, reporting, and archival |
| **Technology** | Kafka C D C and Streams | Airflow D A Gs and S Q L |
| **Failure Recovery** | Kafka offset replay | Checkpoint based retry |
| **Data Freshness** | Always current | Scheduled intervals |
| **Network Impact** | Steady bandwidth | Burst bandwidth |

**ðŸŽ¤ Comparing Sync Modes**

The sync mode comparison shows the tradeoffs between real time and batch approaches.

Real time sync achieves sub second latency with continuous streaming... using Kafka C D C and Streams... ideal for critical alerts and live dashboards that require immediate updates.

Batch sync has fifteen minute to twenty four hour latency with bulk transfer... using Airflow D A Gs and S Q L... ideal for analytics and reporting where scheduled updates are acceptable.

Real time uses moderate C P U with low memory for steady processing.

Batch sync creates high C P U and memory spikes during bulk operations.

For failure recovery... real time uses Kafka offset replay to resume from exactly where it left off.

Batch sync uses checkpoint based retry with watermark tracking.

Network impact differs significantly... real time maintains steady bandwidth usage... while batch sync creates burst bandwidth during scheduled runs.

### **Real-Time CDC Performance**

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **CDC Latency** | Zero point three seconds at p ninety five | Less than one second |
| **Throughput** | Fifty thousand changes per second | Greater than twenty thousand |
| **Replication Lag** | Zero point three seconds at p ninety five | Less than one second |
| **Consumer Processing Rate** | One hundred twenty five thousand events per second | Greater than one hundred thousand |
| **End-to-End Latency** | Three hundred forty milliseconds | Less than one second |
| **Uptime** | Ninety nine point nine seven percent | Greater than ninety nine point nine percent |

**ðŸŽ¤ Real-Time Performance Metrics**

Real time sync implementation uses PostgreSQL logical replication with Debezium connector.

When a fire detection record is inserted into the HOT tier... the database publishes change event to Kafka topic wildfire dot public dot fire detections hot.

The event includes operation type... create, update, or delete... before and after values... and source metadata.

C D C latency is under one second from commit to Kafka publish... with throughput of fifty thousand changes per second.

The Kafka Consumer subscribes to C D C topics and syncs events to clearing house database.

For create operations... insert to clearing house.

For update operations... update in clearing house.

For delete operations... delete from clearing house.

After successful sync... manually commit Kafka offset for exactly once semantics.

Processing rate reaches one hundred twenty five thousand events per second with end to end latency of three hundred forty milliseconds.

Consumer lag stays at zero... meaning the system is always caught up with no backlog.

Uptime is ninety nine point nine seven percent... exceeding our ninety nine point nine percent target.

### **Batch Sync Performance**

| Sync Mode | Schedule | Records Per Run | Duration | Data Freshness | Success Rate |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Incremental Load** | Every fifteen minutes | Twelve thousand four hundred eighty seven | Forty two point seven seconds | Fifteen minutes max lag | Ninety nine point nine four percent |
| **Full Refresh** | Daily at two A M U T C | Twenty eight point seven million | Thirty point eight minutes | Twenty four hours | Ninety nine point eight seven percent |

**ðŸŽ¤ Batch Sync Statistics**

Batch sync implementation supports two modes.

Incremental load uses watermark based tracking.

Get last sync watermark from checkpoint table... example October twenty third at noon.

Extract new records where updated at is greater than last watermark.

Transform and validate each record.

Upsert to clearing house with conflict handling.

Update watermark checkpoint to maximum updated at timestamp.

This runs every fifteen minutes with average duration of forty two point seven seconds syncing twelve thousand four hundred eighty seven records.

Full refresh mode performs complete replacement using atomic swap pattern.

Extract entire dataset from WARM tier Parquet... example twenty eight point seven million records.

Create new temp table.

Load data to temp table.

Swap table names atomically... rename clearing house to old... rename temp to clearing house... drop old table.

This achieves zero downtime.

Rebuild indexes and update statistics for query planner.

Full refresh runs daily at two A M U T C during low traffic period... completing in thirty point eight minutes.

---

### **Conflict Resolution Statistics**

| Scenario | Count Per Day | Percentage | Resolution |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------|
| **No Conflict** | Four hundred eighty six thousand three hundred forty two | Ninety nine point nine percent | Direct insert or update |
| **Same Timestamp** | Four hundred twenty one | Zero point zero eight six percent | Skip update with no change |
| **Older Timestamp** | Eighty nine | Zero point zero one eight percent | Reject update and keep newer |
| **Total** | Four hundred eighty six thousand eight hundred fifty two | One hundred percent | All handled |

**ðŸŽ¤ Handling Conflicts**

Conflict resolution uses last write wins strategy.

When upserting records... the ON CONFLICT clause compares timestamps.

Only update if incoming record timestamp is newer than existing record.

This prevents stale data from overwriting fresh data.

Conflict detection metrics show ninety nine point nine percent no conflict... meaning most records insert or update cleanly.

Zero point zero eight six percent have same timestamp and are skipped with no change.

Zero point zero one eight percent have older timestamp and are rejected to keep the newer data.

All four hundred eighty six thousand eight hundred fifty two daily operations are handled automatically.

---

### **Checkpoint Management**

**Checkpoint Table Structure**

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **source_table** | Name of source dataset | fire_detections_hot |
| **last_watermark** | Timestamp of last sync | October twenty third at two thirty P M |
| **last_sync_at** | When sync completed | October twenty third at two thirty two P M |
| **records_synced** | Count of records processed | Twelve thousand four hundred eighty seven |
| **sync_duration_seconds** | Time taken to sync | Forty two point seven |
| **sync_mode** | Type of sync performed | incremental |

**ðŸŽ¤ Checkpoint Recovery**

Checkpoint management tracks sync progress in checkpoint table.

Each source table has last watermark timestamp... last sync timestamp... records synced count... sync duration... and sync mode.

After failure... recovery reads last checkpoint and resumes from watermark.

For example... if system crashed at two thirty P M... checkpoint shows last watermark at two fifteen P M.

Calculate missed records since checkpoint... example three thousand four hundred twenty one records.

Resume incremental sync from checkpoint watermark.

This ensures no data is lost during outages... and all missed records are recovered on restart.

### **Sync Monitoring Dashboard**

**Grafana Panels**

1. **CDC Replication Lag** - Real time graph of seconds behind source
2. **Consumer Lag** - Kafka consumer offset lag per topic
3. **Batch Sync Status** - Last run time, duration, and records synced
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Daily count of conflicts by type
5. **Checkpoint Watermarks** - Timeline of sync progress per table
6. **Sync Throughput** - Records per second for real time and batch

**Alerting Rules**

- **CDC Lag greater than five seconds** - Page on call engineer
- **Consumer Lag greater than one thousand messages** - Investigate bottleneck
- **Batch Sync Failed** - Retry automatically and alert after three failures
- **Checkpoint Not Updated for over one hour** - Check Airflow scheduler

**ðŸŽ¤ Monitoring and Alerts**

The Sync Monitoring Dashboard visualizes six key panels in Grafana.

C D C Replication Lag shows real time graph of seconds behind source.

Consumer Lag displays Kafka consumer offset lag per topic.

Batch Sync Status shows last run time... duration... and records synced.

Conflict Resolution counts conflicts by type.

Checkpoint Watermarks show timeline of sync progress per table.

And Sync Throughput graphs records per second for real time and batch modes.

Alerting rules ensure reliability.

C D C lag greater than five seconds pages on call engineer.

Consumer lag greater than one thousand messages triggers investigation.

Batch sync failures retry automatically... alerting after three failures.

And checkpoint not updated for over one hour triggers Airflow scheduler check.

This comprehensive dual mode sync keeps the clearing house current with sub second latency.

**ðŸŽ¤ Quality Framework Architecture**

Data quality is the foundation of trustworthy analytics.

Our Data Quality Service on port eight zero zero four implements twenty five plus validation rules across six categories... ensuring every record meets production standards before reaching the clearing house.

The Data Quality Framework has four layers working together.

The Quality Service includes Quality Engine with twenty five plus validation rules... Rule Executor for parallel validation... Score Calculator using weighted average... and Anomaly Detector with M L based detection.

Validation Rules span six categories.

Completeness checks for non null required fields.

Validity checks for range... format... and type.

Consistency checks for cross field logic.

Accuracy checks against reference data.

Timeliness checks for timestamp freshness.

And Uniqueness checks for duplicate detection.

Quality dimensions produce six scores from zero to one.

Completeness Score measures field population.

Validity Score measures data correctness.

Consistency Score measures logical coherence.

Accuracy Score measures reference alignment.

Timeliness Score measures data freshness.

And Uniqueness Score measures duplicate rate.

These six dimension scores combine with weighted average to produce overall quality score.

Quality actions depend on score thresholds.

Score greater than or equal to zero point nine five triggers ACCEPT... high quality passed to production... record visible in clearing house.

Score between zero point eight and zero point nine four triggers WARN... acceptable with warnings... record visible with quality flag warn.

Score between zero point six and zero point eight triggers QUARANTINE... moderate issues requiring manual review... record in quarantine table not visible to users.

Score below zero point six triggers REJECT... critical issues making data unusable... record sent to Dead Letter Queue for retry or discard.

**ðŸŽ¤ Validation Rule Categories**

Let me walk through the validation rules in detail.

Completeness checks include six rules.

Rule C zero one validates required fields are non null... critical fields like latitude... longitude... brightness... timestamp must be present.

Rule C zero two calculates field completeness percentage.

Rule C zero three detects empty strings or whitespace only values.

These completeness checks ensure data is sufficiently populated for analysis.

Validity checks include eight rules.

Rule V zero one validates latitude range negative ninety to positive ninety.

Rule V zero two validates longitude range negative one eighty to positive one eighty.

Rule V zero three validates brightness temperature range from absolute zero at two seventy three point one five Kelvin to maximum fire temperature at five hundred Kelvin.

Rule V zero four validates timestamp format as ISO eight six zero one or Unix epoch.

Rule V zero five validates enum values like confidence must be LOW... NOMINAL... or HIGH.

These validity checks ensure data values are physically and logically possible.

Consistency checks include four rules.

Rule C O zero one validates cross field logic... if fire detected then brightness must be greater than three hundred ten Kelvin.

Rule C O zero two validates temporal consistency... created at must be less than or equal to updated at.

Rule C O zero three validates geographic consistency... location within expected region.

Rule C O zero four validates unit consistency... all temperatures in same unit.

Accuracy checks include three rules.

Rule A zero one validates reference data lookup... county name must exist in reference table.

Rule A zero two validates geocoding accuracy... latitude longitude must match claimed county boundary using PostGIS reverse geocoding.

Rule A zero three validates satellite I D... satellite name must be in known list like VIIRS NOAA twenty... MODIS Aqua.

Timeliness checks include two rules.

Rule T zero one validates timestamp freshness... data not older than seven days for real time use cases.

Rule T zero two detects future timestamps... acquisition date cannot be in future.

Uniqueness checks include two rules.

Rule U zero one validates primary key uniqueness... detection I D must be unique.

Rule U zero two detects duplicate records using S H A two fifty six content hash stored in Redis with fifteen minute T T L.

### **Quality Score Calculation**

**Dimension Weights**

| Dimension | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Completeness** | Twenty five percent | Critical for all datasets |
| **Validity** | Twenty five percent | Critical for all datasets |
| **Consistency** | Fifteen percent | Important but less critical |
| **Accuracy** | Fifteen percent | Important but less critical |
| **Timeliness** | Ten percent | Depends on use case |
| **Uniqueness** | Ten percent | Depends on use case |

**Example Calculation**

| Dimension | Score | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Completeness | One point zero | Twenty five percent | Zero point two five |
| Validity | Zero point eight seven five | Twenty five percent | Zero point two one nine |
| Consistency | Zero point seven five | Fifteen percent | Zero point one one three |
| Accuracy | One point zero | Fifteen percent | Zero point one five |
| Timeliness | Zero point eight | Ten percent | Zero point zero eight |
| Uniqueness | One point zero | Ten percent | Zero point one |
| **Overall** | - | - | **Zero point nine one two** |

**ðŸŽ¤ Calculating Quality Scores**

Quality score calculation uses weighted average across six dimensions.

Completeness weight is twenty five percent... critical for all datasets.

Validity weight is twenty five percent... critical for all datasets.

Consistency weight is fifteen percent... important but less critical.

Accuracy weight is fifteen percent.

Timeliness weight is ten percent... depends on use case.

Uniqueness weight is ten percent.

The weighted sum produces overall quality score from zero to one.

For example... record with completeness one point oh... validity zero point eight seven five... consistency zero point seven five... accuracy one point oh... timeliness zero point eight... and uniqueness one point oh... calculates to overall score of zero point nine one two... which falls in WARN threshold.

### **Quality Statistics**

| Metric | Value | Calculation Period |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **Total Records Validated** | Four hundred eighty seven million two hundred thirty four thousand eight hundred ninety one | Last thirty days |
| **Average Quality Score** | Zero point nine four seven | Overall |
| **ACCEPT Rate** | Ninety four point two percent or four hundred fifty nine million records | score greater than or equal to zero point nine five |
| **WARN Rate** | Four point eight percent or twenty three point four million records | zero point eight to zero point nine five |
| **QUARANTINE Rate** | Zero point eight percent or three point nine million records | zero point six to zero point eight |
| **REJECT Rate** | Zero point two percent or nine hundred seventy four thousand records | score less than zero point six |
| **Validation Throughput** | One hundred twenty five thousand records per second | Real time |
| **Validation Latency at p ninety five** | Twelve milliseconds | Per record |

**ðŸŽ¤ Production Quality Results**

Quality statistics from production show impressive results.

Four hundred eighty seven million records validated in last thirty days.

Average quality score is zero point nine four seven.

ACCEPT rate is ninety four point two percent... four hundred fifty nine million records with score greater than or equal to zero point nine five.

WARN rate is four point eight percent... twenty three point four million records.

QUARANTINE rate is zero point eight percent... three point nine million records.

REJECT rate is only zero point two percent... nine hundred seventy four thousand records.

Validation throughput reaches one hundred twenty five thousand records per second with twelve millisecond latency at ninety fifth percentile.

### **ML Anomaly Detection**

**Detection Methods**

| Method | Purpose | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Isolation Forest** | Point anomalies like sensor malfunction | Zero point zero four percent | Two point three percent |
| **LSTM Network** | Temporal anomalies like unusual patterns over time | Zero point zero four percent | Two point three percent |
| **Combined** | Maximum of both detectors | One hundred ninety five thousand per day | Ninety seven point seven percent accuracy |

**Common Anomalies Detected**

- Sensor malfunction reporting nine ninety nine point nine Fahrenheit
- Coordinate errors with latitude longitude swapped
- Unusual fire patterns with multiple fires in tight cluster

**ðŸŽ¤ Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**

Anomaly detection uses M L models... Isolation Forest for point anomalies and L S T M for temporal anomalies.

Isolation Forest detects unusual individual records like sensor malfunction reporting nine ninety nine point nine Fahrenheit.

L S T M detects unusual patterns over time like sudden spike in fire detections.

Detection rate is zero point zero four percent... one hundred ninety five thousand anomalies per day.

False positive rate is only two point three percent... meaning ninety seven point seven percent of flagged anomalies are confirmed true anomalies after manual review.

This comprehensive quality assurance framework ensures only trustworthy data reaches the clearing house.

**ðŸŽ¤ Complete Validation Pipeline**

The validation pipeline is a sophisticated multi stage process that combines rule based validation with M L powered anomaly detection... ensuring only high quality data reaches the clearing house.

Let me walk you through the complete flow.

Every incoming data record starts with Parse and Deserialize... converting Avro... JSON... or Parquet formats into structured objects.

This feeds into Validation Stage One... Schema Compliance... the gatekeeper that performs fast fail for malformed data.

Using Avro schema validation with strict type checking... we validate fifty thousand records per second with zero point five millisecond latency at ninety fifth percentile.

Records that fail schema validation are immediately rejected and sent to Dead Letter Queue.

This catches zero point zero two percent of records... just two hundred per million... preventing expensive business rule validation on garbage data.

Records that pass schema compliance move to Validation Stage Two... Business Rules.

Here we execute twenty five validation rules across six categories in parallel.

Completeness rules run six checks for non null fields and field population.

Validity rules run eight checks for ranges... formats... and types.

Consistency rules run four checks for cross field logic.

Accuracy rules run three checks against reference data.

Timeliness rules run two checks for timestamp freshness.

And Uniqueness rules run two checks for duplicates.

By executing these six rule groups in parallel across six CPU cores... we achieve six point two five times speedup... completing all twenty five rules in just twelve milliseconds instead of seventy five milliseconds sequential.

After parallel rule execution... we aggregate results from all twenty five validation checks and calculate the quality score using weighted average.

Completeness and Validity get twenty five percent weight each... Consistency and Accuracy get fifteen percent each... and Timeliness and Uniqueness get ten percent each.

Next comes M L Anomaly Detection.

Two machine learning models work together to detect unusual patterns.

Isolation Forest detects point anomalies... individual records that are statistically unusual like sensor malfunctions or coordinate errors.

L S T M Network detects temporal anomalies... unusual patterns over time like sudden spike in fire detections or off hours activity.

The anomaly score determines the penalty applied to quality score.

Severe anomaly with score above zero point seven applies twenty percent penalty.

Moderate anomaly with score above zero point five applies ten percent penalty.

Mild anomaly with score above zero point three applies five percent penalty.

Normal records with score below zero point three receive no penalty.

Let me show you an example.

A record with base quality score of zero point nine four seven from business rules... but M L models detect moderate anomaly with score zero point six seven... applies ten percent penalty.

Final score equals zero point nine four seven times zero point nine equals zero point eight five two three... which falls into WARN threshold instead of ACCEPT.

The final quality score determines the action.

Score greater than or equal to zero point nine five triggers ACCEPT... insert to clearing house with success metrics logged.

Score between zero point eight and zero point nine four triggers WARN... insert with quality flag warn and warning metrics logged.

Score between zero point six and zero point eight triggers QUARANTINE... record held for manual review with alert sent to ops team.

Score below zero point six triggers REJECT... record sent to Dead Letter Queue for retry with exponential backoff.

### **Validation Performance**

| Stage | Latency at p fifty | Latency at p ninety five | Throughput |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Schema Compliance** | Zero point five milliseconds | One point two milliseconds | Fifty thousand records per second |
| **Business Rules Parallel** | Eight point seven milliseconds | Twelve point three milliseconds | One hundred twenty five thousand records per second |
| **ML Anomaly Detection** | Three point four milliseconds | Seven point eight milliseconds | One hundred twenty five thousand records per second |
| **Total End to End** | Twelve milliseconds | Fifteen milliseconds | One hundred twenty five thousand records per second |

**ðŸŽ¤ Pipeline Performance**

Performance is impressive.

Schema compliance validates at zero point five millisecond latency.

Business rules complete in twelve milliseconds with parallel execution.

M L anomaly detection adds just three point four milliseconds median latency.

Total end to end validation pipeline completes in under fifteen milliseconds at ninety fifth percentile.

This sophisticated validation flow protects the clearing house from bad data while maintaining high throughput.

### **Dead Letter Queue Statistics**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **DLQ Ingestion Rate** | Nine hundred seventy four records per day | Zero point two percent of total records |
| **Retry Success Rate** | Sixty eight point three percent | Recovered after retry |
| **Permanent Failures** | Thirty one point seven percent | Moved to permanent failure after five attempts |
| **Average Retries to Success** | Two point four attempts | Most succeed on second or third try |
| **Max Backoff Time** | Sixteen minutes | After four failed attempts |

**ðŸŽ¤ Retry and Recovery**

The Dead Letter Queue implements intelligent retry logic.

Background process scans D L Q every minute for records ready to retry.

Exponential backoff uses one minute... two minutes... four minutes... eight minutes... sixteen minutes delays.

After five failed attempts... record moves to permanent failure table.

D L Q statistics show sixty eight point three percent retry success rate... meaning most rejected records eventually recover after transient issues are resolved.

Average retries to success is two point four attempts.

**ðŸŽ¤ SLA Framework Overview**

Service Level Agreements define measurable targets for data quality dimensions... providing clear expectations for data consumers and accountability for data producers.

Our S L A Framework tracks three critical dimensions... Freshness... Completeness... and Consistency... with real time monitoring and automated enforcement.

The S L A Framework has four layers working together.

S L A Definitions specify target thresholds for each dimension.

S L A Monitoring provides real time tracking with compliance calculator showing percentage meeting targets... violation detector triggering alerts... and report generator producing daily... weekly... and monthly reports.

S L A Enforcement includes auto healing to trigger data refresh when violations detected... escalation policy with tiered notifications... remediation workflow for issue tracking... and postmortem analysis for root cause investigation.

And S L A Reporting delivers insights via Grafana real time dashboard... dataset scorecard rankings... trend reports with historical analysis... and executive summary with monthly K P Is.

Stakeholders interact with the framework at different levels.

S L A Owners define targets for their datasets.

Data Consumers rely on S L A compliance for their analytics.

Operations Team enforces S L A through monitoring and remediation.

Executives track compliance through monthly reports.
